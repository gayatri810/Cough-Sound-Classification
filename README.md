# Cough-Sound-Classifiction
Digital Signal Processing mini project that classifies cough sounds (Covid, Tuberculosis, Healthy) using MATLAB and DSP tools.


# DSP Mini Project — Cough Classification 🩺🎧

This project was developed as part of my Digital Signal Processing mini-project.  
The main idea is to classify different cough sounds (Covid, Tuberculosis, and Healthy) using basic DSP techniques, MATLAB and Machine Learning. The goal was to apply concepts learned in class to a real-world health-related problem.


## 📌 Project Summary

- Implemented in MATLAB
- Focused on analyzing and classifying cough audio signals
- Used signal processing steps like filtering, feature extraction, and classification
- Categorized cough sounds into:
  - Covid Cough
  - Tuberculosis Cough
  - Healthy Cough

This is a simple but practical project to explore how DSP can be used in the medical field.


## 🧰 Tools & Techniques

- **Language:** MATLAB  
- **Concepts Used:** Digital Signal Processing, Audio Feature Extraction, Random Forest Classifier  
- **Dataset:** Cough audio files collected from public datasets, a website called coughvid


## 📁 Folder Structure
DSP_Project
├── main.m # MATLAB file with full project code
└── README.md # Project documentation


## ⚡ How to Run

1. Open `main.m` in MATLAB.  
2. Set the dataset folder path in the code.  
3. Run the script.  
4. The program will display the predicted class for each cough sample.


## 🚀 What I Learned

- Applying DSP concepts on real audio data  
- Working with MATLAB for classification  
- Understanding basic signal features like energy and zero crossing rate  
- Structuring a mini project from scratch


## 📈 Future Plans

- Adding more classes and data for better accuracy  
- Trying ML/DL models for comparison  
- Building a small GUI to make the tool more user friendly
